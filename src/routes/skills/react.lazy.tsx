          React enables you to create both web and native applications using a single skill set. By leveraging each platform's distinct features, React ensures that your interfaces are perfectly tailored for every platform.
          React boasts a vast ecosystem, making it the most popular JavaScript library for building web applications. Its extensive resources enhance developer productivity and provide significant relief by simplifying tasks that were previously cumbersome with vanilla JavaScript or AJAX. While AJAX has its merits, React has essentially rendered it obsolete by offering a more efficient and streamlined development experience.
