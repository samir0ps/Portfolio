It's built on top of React and provides a number of features that make it ideal for building full-stack web applications. Some of the key benefits of using Next.js include: Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG): Next.js allows you to choose between SSR and SSG for different parts of your application. SSR is ideal for pages that require dynamic data or user authentication, while SSG is a great option for pages that are mostly static and don't change frequently. This flexibility can improve the performance and SEO of your application. Improved developer experience: Next.js includes a number of features that can make development faster and easier, such as automatic code splitting, built-in routing, and hot reloading. Large community and ecosystem: Next.js has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are a wide range of resources available to help you learn and use the framework. There's also a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that can be used to extend the functionality of Next.js applications."}),e.jsxs("button",{onClick:n,className:"rounded-full py-3 px-10 gap-1 hover:bg-zinc-950 transition-all   duration-150 mt-3 bg-black flex items-center",children:["Next Docs",e.jsx(a,{})]})]})}export{r as Route};
