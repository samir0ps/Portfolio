I'm Mahmoud Samir, a passionate web developer based in Egypt. With a love for clean code and innovative solutions, I specialize in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My go-to language is TypeScript, which I prefer over JavaScript for its robust type-checking and advanced features. Currently, Iâ€™m working with modern frameworks and tools such as Next.js, leveraging its Theme Provider for seamless dark and light mode integration. I enjoy crafting intuitive interfaces, and my latest project involves a sophisticated combobox designed to efficiently handle subcategories. For authentication and database management, I rely on Kinde and Supabase, ensuring secure and scalable applications. My journey in web development is driven by a constant desire to learn and adapt, always striving to deliver the best user experience. When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, experimenting with design, and sharing my knowledge with the developer community. Welcome to my corner of the web!"})]})]})})}export{d as Route};
